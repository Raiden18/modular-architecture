# Modular-architecture
Project was based on [Navigation in Multi-Module Projects - ProAndroidDev](https://medium.com/p/navigation-in-multi-module-projects-9a5c53ad219) but then I decided to implement DI via Koin, and isolate third party framework(Glide) and navigation from the application. And to manage dependencies the same as samples from Google. 


A purpose of of project is testing navigation  component in multimodule architectire before starting a new project at [Live Typing](https://livetyping.com/en/)
